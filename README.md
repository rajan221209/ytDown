YT Down is a simple comand line tool made using Pytube.

I got this idea when one day I needed to quickly download a video from youtube and I didn't have youtube premium at the time.
I know doing that is possible but the quote is true "Never trust anyone on the internet".

This tool allows you to download any youtube video as mp3 and mp4.

Usage in command line:

ytDown.exe [audio/video] [youtube video link]
